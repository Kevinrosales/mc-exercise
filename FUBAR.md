WhY ArEnT My ThInGs LOaDeD

“In the meantime, Bob & Carol have switched to Bob’s laptop, started a new feature branch in FUBAR.md, and started working on it. They did not do a git pull origin master and will live to regret it. They finish that feature at the same time that Ted & Alice finish their feature. Each team does an A-C-P and makes a PR. They review each other’s PRs and attempt to merge them.”s

This is what Bob & Carol did on Bob's computer when working on the first feature.  Cool.  Alright.
This is what Ted and Alice Cooper did on Ted Nugent's computer. They determined that school was out for summer and that they have cat scratch fever.


Ted is adding this second round of changes.  Lets see how this goes...

This is Bob and Carol on Carol's computer. Bob is really nice and I like pizza but the Code 301 class would not give me any.

Brrrng brrrrng "hello" --> "this is bob and carol we were just calling to lef you know that we are hungry for pizza and love mag-luv."
