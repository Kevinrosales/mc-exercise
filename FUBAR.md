“In the meantime, Bob & Carol have switched to Bob’s laptop, started a new feature branch in FUBAR.md, and started working on it. They did not do a git pull origin master and will live to regret it. They finish that feature at the same time that Ted & Alice finish their feature. Each team does an A-C-P and makes a PR. They review each other’s PRs and attempt to merge them.”s

This is what Bob & Carol did on Bob's computer when working on the first feature.  Cool.  Alright.
This is what Ted and Alice Cooper did on Ted Nugent's computer. They determined that school was out for summer and that they have cat scratch fever.
