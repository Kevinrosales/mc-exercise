Bob did not update his master branch before making a new branch so the changes were not local to his computer. As a result he created the merge conflicts. What we learned is that you must always always sync your local computer and git before trying to merge new changes into git. Bob and Alice made the mistake of not creating a new branch. Similarly, Ted and Carol started a new feature on the master branch rather than creating a new branch.
